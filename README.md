# Advent of code 2022

This is my attempt at advent of code 2022.

The problems can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

# Getting started

## Configuration

Config is passed via a .env file (which is excluded from the repo via .gitignore).

The package `aocd` is used to download the data and upload solutions. A variable called `AOC_SESSION` must be added to the environmental variables (I'd recommend doing this via the .env file, but whatever works for you!). This is a cookie which is set when you login to AoC. You can find it with your browser inspector.
